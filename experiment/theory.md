## The Gaussian elimination method consists of two steps:

### Forward elimination: This involves a step by step reduction of the system into row echelon form.
### Back Substitution: In this process mth equation is first solved for the value of x~n. This value is now used to solve (m-1)^th equation for the value of x~n-1 and so on.
