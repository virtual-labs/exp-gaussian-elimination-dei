### Procedure
## Procedure for the Gaussian Elimination method is as follows:

### Frame the augmented matrix of the given mxn system of linear equations.Reduce the matrix into echelon form by applying elementary row operations

### Row echelon form matrix 2 to be added

### If the row echelon form has row of the form (0 0 ---- 0 | b) where b â‰  0, then stop. The system is inconsistent and has no solution.
### If in the row echelon form the number of leading 1's = n, then the system has a unique solution.

### Row echelon form matrix 2 to be added

### If in the row echelon form the number of leading 1's < n, then the system has infinitely many solutions.
### Back substitution is finally performed to obtain the solution(s).
